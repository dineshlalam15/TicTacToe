TIC TAC TOE GAME

1. First we'll initialise a 3x3 Board.
2. Every box in the board should be of empty space (' ').
3. Two players will play the game - 'X' & 'O'.

Code Explanation
1. In every turn, player chooses the position (row,col) he want
keep his mark in the game board (3x3).
Eg. 0 1, 2 0, 0 0, 2 2, 1 1 etc...

2. There are two functions "printBoard()" and "haveWon()"
written in the code.
printBoard() - prints the Game Board.
haveWon() - It's the Winning Algorithm of this game.

3. In the main function - while loop for every turn we will
check if the player has won the game (haveWon()).
If any player has won the game we'll declare the player won and
stop the game or else the other player will get his turn to play.

haveWon() - Winning Algorithm!
1. Check for rows - All positions must be filled with
the same player in a row.
2. Check for column - All positions must be filled with
the same player in a column.
3. Checking for Diagonals.
